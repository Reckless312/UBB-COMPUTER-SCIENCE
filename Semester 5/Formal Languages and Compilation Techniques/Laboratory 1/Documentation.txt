Grading System DSL

-The DSL is made for school grade management. It allows you to create an empty list for grades (create course) or assigning a value to it (create course algebra = [1, 2, 3]), to which you could add more grades, sort or print as needed.

-Control flow constructs like if and for are implemented to be able to iterate over the elements and apply custom filters (for x in numbers if x > 5 ... end end).

-The DSL also provides the most common used functions, good examples would be the "final_grade" and "possible_grade" which will return the final grade for the course, or a possible grade based on extra grades (final_grade(algebra), possible_grade(algebra, [6,7])).

Samples:

create course algebra
algebra add 8
algebra sort asc
algebra print

for x in algebra
	if x == 10
		x print
		
sum(algebra)
final_grade(algebra) print
length(algebra)
