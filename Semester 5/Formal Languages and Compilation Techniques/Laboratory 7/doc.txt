The grammar is almost a 1:1 definition with the BNF from lab 1.
I added a call keyword, because I wanted to call a function without it being a implicit expression.
It uses the "tokens" returned by lex, and also declares its owns.
Some other modifications from the original BNF might be including paranthesis in some places, but still small changes.
It also just prints the "statements", as in hardcoded prints, not passing the values given by $1, $2,...
