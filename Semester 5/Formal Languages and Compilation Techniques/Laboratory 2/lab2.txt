// Improvements from lab 1 before checking with LLM
// -> changing the add statement to accept one or more than 1 value
// -> added the "output" statement, similar to print, but it displays actual messages to the screen
// -> added else and elif statements for the if statement in the examples
// -> added function definitions for better examples

// Program 1 -> simple check on a course
