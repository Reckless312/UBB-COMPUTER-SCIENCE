# 5) Write an UDP broadcast application that serves as client and server at the same time.
#    The application is started with the network broadcast address (<NBCAST>) as argument in the command line.
#
# 1. Upon launching the application listens on UDP port 7777.
# 2. Every 3 seconds the application sends a UDP broadcast message to NBCAST port 7777 with the format: TIMEQUERY\0 (string)
# 3. Whenever the application receives a TIMEQUERY demand it answers to the source IP:
#     port with a string message: TIME HH:MM:SS\0 (current time) using unicast.
# 4. Every 10 seconds the application sends a UDP broadcast message to NBCAST port 7777 with the format:  DATEQUERY\0 (string)
# 5. Whenever the application receives a DATEQUERY demand it answers to the source IP:port with a string message:
#     DATE DD:MM:YYYY\0 (current date) using unicast.
# 6. The application will keep a list of peers (that answer to broadcast â€“ IP:portno) and
#     update the information anytime a unicast message is received upon a broadcast.
# 7. When an entry in a list does not have any answer for 3 consecutive broadcasts it will be removed from the list.
# 8. The list will be displayed (ip, date, time) on the screen upon each update
#     (using a screen positioning api like conio or by erasing the screen before each update).
# 9. Every malformed request/response received will be counted and displayed at the end of a screen update.
#     You will have a list of malformed messages displayed with their source IP address.
#     The list should be limited in size and implemented as a queue.
#     Recent messages are added to the head and old messages are moving towards the tail.
